## Git & Commits

#### Git
Perform work in a feature branch.

Branch out from develop

Never push into develop or master branch. Make a Pull Request.

Delete local and remote feature branches after merging.

Before making a Pull Request, make sure your feature branch builds successfully and passes all tests (including code style checks).
#### Commits

Write clean, single-purpose commits. Don't get sidetracked! Commit one particular thing at a time. 
- Easier to see changes and code reviews will be more efficient
- Commit rollback is far easier
- Straightforward to track changes in the ticketing system

Best way to achieve clean, single-purpose commits? Commit early and commit often

Generally speaking, you shouldn't commit generated files. Only commit files that take manual effort to create.

Use a rigged commit message format and be a better programmer for it

- Prefix a type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test
- Summary in present tense

``` 
chore: add Oyster build script
docs: explain hat wobble
feat: add beta sequence
fix: remove broken confirmation message
refactor: share logic between 4d3d3d3 and flarhgunnstow
style: convert tabs to spaces
test: ensure Tayne retains clothing
```
