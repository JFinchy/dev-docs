## Testing

- Prefer End-to-End and integration tests. Work End-to-End tests into CI/CD
- MSW for front-end mocking. Interestingly, they are creating a new open source for handling CRUD mocking with a mock DB.
- Supertest for API testing.
- Cypress for End-to-End

Kent C. Dodds is a great reference for this.
