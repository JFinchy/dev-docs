## Naming Convention

camelCase naming convention
- fooBar.js
- let fooBar

### File Naming
  
separate file details by period
- fooBar.test.js
- fooBar.helper.js

use eslint unicorn for file naming enforcement
```js
"unicorn/filename-case": [
	"error",
	{
		"cases": {
			"camelCase": true,
			"pascalCase": true
		}
	}
]
```

### Variable Naming
#### S-I-D

A name must be _short_, _intuitive_ and _descriptive_:

- **Short**. A name must not take long to type and, therefore, remember;
- **Intuitive**. A name must read naturally, as close to the common speech as possible;
- **Descriptive**. A name must reflect what it does/possesses in the most efficient way.

```js
/* Bad */
const a = 5 // "a" could mean anything
const isPaginatable = a > 10 // "Paginatable" sounds extremely unnatural
const shouldPaginatize = a > 10 // Made up verbs are so much fun!

/* Good */
const postCount = 5
const hasPagination = postCount > 10
const shouldPaginate = postCount > 10 // alternatively
```

#### Avoid contractions

Do **not** use contractions. They contribute to nothing but decreased readability of the code. Finding a short, descriptive name may be hard, but contraction is not an excuse for not doing so.

```js
/* Bad */
const onItmClk = () => {}

/* Good */
const onItemClick = () => {}
```

#### Avoid context duplication

A name should not duplicate the context in which it is defined. Always remove the context from a name if that doesn't decrease its readability.

```js
class MenuItem {
  /* Method name duplicates the context (which is "MenuItem") */
  handleMenuItemClick = (event) => { ... }

  /* Reads nicely as `MenuItem.handleClick()` */
  handleClick = (event) => { ... }
}
```

#### Reflect the expected result

A name should reflect the expected result.

```jsx
/* Bad */
const isEnabled = itemCount > 3
return <Button disabled={!isEnabled} />

/* Good */
const isDisabled = itemCount <= 3
return <Button disabled={isDisabled} />
```

### Function Naming
#### A/HC/LC Pattern

There is a useful pattern to follow when naming functions:

```
prefix? + action (A) + high context (HC) + low context? (LC)
```

Take a look at how this pattern may be applied in the table below.

| Name                   | Prefix   | Action (A) | High context (HC) | Low context (LC) |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| `getUser`              |          | `get`      | `User`            |                  |
| `getUserMessages`      |          | `get`      | `User`            | `Messages`       |
| `handleClickOutside`   |          | `handle`   | `Click`           | `Outside`        |
| `shouldDisplayMessage` | `should` | `Display`  | `Message`         |                  |

> **Note:** The order of context affects the meaning of a variable. For example, `shouldUpdateComponent` means _you_ are about to update a component, while `shouldComponentUpdate` tells you that _component_ will update on itself, and you are but controlling when it should be updated.
> In other words, **high context emphasizes the meaning of a variable**.

#### Actions

The verb part of your function name. The most important part responsible for describing what the function _does_.

`get` - Accesses data immediately (i.e. shorthand getter of internal data).

`set` - Sets a variable in a declarative way, with value `A` to value `B`.

`reset` - Sets a variable back to its initial value or state.

`fetch` - Request for some data, which takes some indeterminate time (i.e. async request).

`remove` - Removes something _from_ somewhere. For example, if you have a collection of selected filters on a search page, removing one of them from the collection is `removeFilter`, **not** `deleteFilter` (and this is how you would naturally say it in English as well):

`delete` - Completely erases something from the realms of existence. Imagine you are a content editor, and there is that notorious post you wish to get rid of. Once you clicked a shiny "Delete post" button, the CMS performed a `deletePost` action, **not** `removePost`.

`compose` - Creates new data from the existing one. Mostly applicable to strings, objects, or functions.

`handle` - Handles an action. Often used when naming a callback method.

#### Context

A domain that a function operates on.

A function is often an action on _something_. It is important to state what its operable domain is, or at least an expected data type.

```js
/* A pure function operating with primitives */
function filter(list, predicate) {
  return list.filter(predicate)
}

/* Function operating exactly on posts */
function getRecentPosts(posts) {
  return filter(posts, (post) => post.date === Date.now())
}
```

> Some language-specific assumptions may allow omitting the context. For example, in JavaScript, it's common that `filter` operates on Array. Adding explicit `filterArray` would be unnecessary.
#### Prefixes

Prefix enhances the meaning of a variable. It is rarely used in function names.

`is` - Describes a characteristic or state of the current context (usually `boolean`). Ex: isBlue, isPresent

`has` - Describes whether the current context possesses a certain value or state (usually `boolean`). 

```js
/* Bad */
const isProductsExist = productsCount > 0
const areProductsPresent = productsCount > 0

/* Good */
const hasProducts = productsCount > 0
```

`should` - Reflects a positive conditional statement (usually `boolean`) coupled with a certain action. Ex: shouldUpdateUrl

```js
function shouldUpdateUrl(url, expectedUrl) {
  return url !== expectedUrl
}
```

`min`/`max` - Represents a minimum or maximum value. Used when describing boundaries or limits.

`prev`/`next` - Indicate the previous or the next state of a variable in the current context. Used when describing state transitions.

#### Singular and Plurals

Like a prefix, variable names can be made singular or plural depending on whether they hold a single value or multiple values.

```js
/* Bad */
const friends = 'Bob'
const friend = ['Bob', 'Tony', 'Tanya']

/* Good */
const friend = 'Bob'
const friends = ['Bob', 'Tony', 'Tanya']
```


#### API Naming

We mostly follow resource-oriented design. It has three main factors: resources, collection, and URLs.

- A resource has data, gets nested, and there are methods that operate against it.
- A group of resources is called a collection.
- URL identifies the online location of resource or collection.

use kebab-case for URLs.

use camelCase for parameters in the query string or resource fields.

use plural kebab-case for resource names in URLs.

Always use a plural nouns for naming a url pointing to a collection: /users.

Always use a singular concept that starts with a collection and ends to an identifier:

```
/students/245743
/airports/kjfk
```

Response messages must be self-descriptive. A good error message response might look something like this:
- Have an error message always return a message and status code. Optionally, return a code and description. 
```json
{
    "code": 401,
    "message" : "Authentication failed",
    "description" : "Invalid username or password"
}
```

Use Swagger's open API for API design and documentation 

Use these status codes to send with your response to describe whether everything worked, The client app did something wrong or The API did something wrong.

Which ones:

`200` - OK response represents success for GET, PUT or POST requests.

`201` - Created for when a new instance is created. Creating a new instance, using POST method returns 201 status code.

`204` - No Content response represents success but there is no content to be sent in the response. Use it when DELETE operation succeeds.

`304` - Not Modified response is to minimize information transfer when the recipient already has cached representations.

`400` - Bad Request for when the request was not processed, as the server could not understand what the client is asking for.

`401` - Unauthorized for when the request lacks valid credentials and it should re-request with the required credentials.

`403` - Forbidden means the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.

`404` - Not Found indicates that the requested resource was not found.

`500` - Internal Server Error indicates that the request is valid, but the server could not fulfill it due to some unexpected condition.

#### Branch Naming

- Use hyphens as seperators ('_')
- For space between groupings use slash ('-')
- Go lowercase

1. Start branch name with request number
2. Next use group keywords bug/wip/feat/hotfix/experimental
3. Finish with short descriptor of the task

Examples:
21830_bug__form-event-bubbling
512311_feat_add-fb-oauth-login
