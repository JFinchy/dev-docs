## Folder Structure

- Don't get loose with where you keep documents. All projects should start in documents/repos
- If projects are coupled together have a workspace for them
- Follow the concept of co-location. Place code as close to where it's relevant as possible. 
  - If you have an abstraction used all over, make a utils folder and place it in there
  - If your fn, component, stylesheet, etc. is only used in one place, keep it with that one place. When the place get's overrun, make a file nearby to keep it. If the code starts getting used other places determine if it's time to abstract it out.
