# Introduction
 
Welcome to my dev docs! Here I'm going to capture all the most valuable things I've learned over my developer journey. This started when I met with someone looking for there first developer position and I had a hard time capturing all the nuanced elements that come with the role.

I've also found that many think the position is somewhat easy or is can be simply automated by AI since it's just printing components to a page, though parts can be, there is a lot too it that I've learned over the years through my successes but mostly failures :sweat-smile.

## So what is it?

My *strange* version of a best practices, tips, gotchas, etc. I'll also share my favorite links/tools etc. I won't break down everything, there are plenty of awesome resources for that, but I will share what mental models I use and the main things I think about. Also, to be clear, I'm not saying it's the right way, just how I like to think about it
